# PersonalApp
React native playground for myself.

You need to have a Google Vision API Key in order for this app to run.

To open the app, you'll need to download Expo in your phone and the Expo CLI for your laptop.
First, go to your directory file, and then run the command "npm start".
Then, a metro bundler will show up from your browser, and after it says "tunnel ready", change the connection to Tunnel.
Open expo from your phone, and then scan the QR Code on your metro bundler. Then you wait until the app is loaded on your phone.
